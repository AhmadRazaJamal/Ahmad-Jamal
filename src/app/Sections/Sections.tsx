                <Text>I have been working professionally as a Developer for almost 4 years now, but have been fiddling with tech for almost 20.</Text>
                <Text>Over the last few years I've had the opportunity to team up with some amazing people at startups like HigherGround, FreshGrade, and presently Fresh Tracks Canada. Working at these fast-paced and exciting startups has shaped me into the versatile developer I am today.</Text>
                <Text>I am a big believer in constantly pushing yourself and learning something new everyday. That's why I poured my heart and soul into revamping my old portfolio. I've used fantastic, modern tools like Next.js, Tailwind, and Three.js to build the website's skeleton; and Blender to create a 3D model of my office.</Text>
