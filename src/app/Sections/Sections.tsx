                    the product's functionality while meeting the needs of educators and students.
                </Text>
                <Text>This experience allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the intersection between education and technology, and to hone my skills in product development, user experience, and collaboration.</Text>

                <Text>FreshGrade was later acquired by HigherGround which is a Montessori-inspired educational offering. During my time at HigherGround, I worked on improving the scalability and website performance of the existing infrastructure. I also collaborated with a team of designers and developers to create new features and functionalities for the product. All of this allowed me to further enhance my skills in software engineering, teamwork, and project management.</Text>
